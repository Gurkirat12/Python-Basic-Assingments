1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

* --> Expression

'hello' --> String

-87.8 --> integer(float)

-  --> Expression

/  --> Expression

+ --> Expression

6 --> integer


2. What is the difference between string and variable?

String is datatype which is collection of characters or alpha numeric or numeric and always in quotes eg "ABCD123"
where as variable is address where we store our data so when we have to use data we can call them by there address Eg a = "1234dhaks" 
here a is variable which stores the address of the string.

3. Describe three different data types.

  4. bolean

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

An expression is combination of varriable, operators, and method which are combine to form a syntax of a language

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

when spam = 10 it is statement while when it is compiled by compiler and value is obtain then it is called expression

bacon contains 23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'
'spam' * 3 ='spamspamspam'

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
bcoz there are strict rules in programming that variable can not be start with numerical values 

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
int() for integer
float() for floating-point number
str() for string

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'
can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
