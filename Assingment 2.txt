1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
the two values of boolean are
true-->1
falese-->0

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
And , Or , Not are the three opreators

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

And --> T   F   O
        1   1   1
        1   0   0
        0   1   0
        0   0   0

Or -->  T   F   O
        1   1   1
        1   0   1
        0   1   1
        0   0   0

Not --> A  O    
        1  0
  	0  1


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) ---> False
not (5 > 4) ---> False
(5 >4) or (3 == 5) ---> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) ---> False
(True and True) and (True == False) ---> False
(not False) or (not True) --->True
        

5. What are the six comparison operators?
1<
2>
3<=
4>=
5==
6!= 

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

assignment operator is used to assign a value to variable using symbol "="
and equal to is used to compare the two or more values usimg symbol"=="


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
1st block
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')

2nd block

if spam > 5:
print('bacon')

3rd

else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input("enter the value"))

if spam == 1 :
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2 :
    print('Howdy')
else :
    print("Greetings!")


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

we can use crtl + C to truncate the loop

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Break can terminate the whole loop where as continue can terminate the current iteration fall the loop to next iteration

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
range(10)--> means loop will start from initial and stop at 10 - 1 up ti which  it has to return the sequence 
range(0,10) --> here it defined the start and stop point of the loop loop will start at 0 and end at 10 -1 will do 10 iterations  
range(0,10,1)-->here it means start at 0 stop at 10 with the increment of 1 in each iteration up to its stop value.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(1,11):
    print(i) 

count = 1
while(count<=10):
    print(count)
    count+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

spam.bacon() we can call the bacon() function
